        i'm 19 years old, my pronouns are she/her, and i'm open to discuss about everything. i'm pretty liberal and individualistic. i prioritize my work before anything else and i enjoy working myself to the bone. i can't stay still for more than 30 minutes without tinkering with something. that's why i do everything: i cook, bake, paint, draw, sculpt, write, code, you name it - i do it. -->

        my pronouns are she/her. i do basically everything. i was an international student, the youngest daughter in a loving family of 4, and a proud cat owner (my cat's name is michelle). my favorite color is #FFD1DC and my favorite food is éº»è¾£é¦™é”…. i'm red/green color blind (it's not too bad, don't worry)

        i'm also a high-functioning autistic and is allergic/intolerant to most of the things you probably like (bananas and milk, for starters)
