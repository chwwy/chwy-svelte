        i'm 19 years old, my pronouns are she/her, and i'm open to discuss about everything. i'm pretty liberal and individualistic. i prioritize my work before anything else and i enjoy working myself to the bone. i can't stay still for more than 30 minutes without tinkering with something. that's why i do everything: i cook, bake, paint, draw, sculpt, write, code, you name it - i do it. -->

        my pronouns are she/her. i do basically everything. i'm an avid book reader, the youngest daughter in a loving family of 4, and a proud cat owner (my cat's name is michelle). my favorite color is #FFD1DC.

        i play video games a lot and i'm a huge listener of taylor swift and shoegaze (wisp and whirr). i'm a student of both literature and computer science and i'd like to think that i'm not bad at either of it.
