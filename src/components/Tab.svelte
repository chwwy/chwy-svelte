        hi! i'm 19 years old. i'm bilingual (english-indo) and know some japanese, russian, and korean. i love mathematics n literature ðŸ’– i'd like to think i'm a great asset to have because i tend to hyperfocus and do not like when my task is not finished. i also have managed projects in the past.
        <br><br>
        i am communicative and is a fast learner - i can easily adapt and is not afraid to say "i don't know" so i won't be wasting your time by pretending to be a know-it-all. oh, i also am not afraid to ask questions.
